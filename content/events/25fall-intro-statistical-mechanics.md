## Description

This 8 week course introduces the fundamental results of thermodynamics through a statistical mechanics viewpoint. Starting from the most fundamental principles of just knowing how to count, this class rederives laws of physics ranging from the ideal gas law to the properties of magnetism. Prerequisites: Calculus (MVC Preferred), Knowledge of Basic Mechanics
