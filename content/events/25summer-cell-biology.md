## Description

This four-week course is designed for middle and high school students with a strong foundation in biology who want to explore the microscopic world of cells in depth. Students will learn what defines life at the cellular level, how cells are structured, and how they carry out essential life processes. Weâ€™ll compare prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, explore the roles of key organelles, and dive into topics like passive/active transport, signaling pathways, and how cells reproduce. By the end of the course, students will be able to explain how cells maintain homeostasis, respond to stimuli, and divide, all while using the correct scientific terminology. This fast-paced course is ideal for students preparing for advanced biology, biomedical sciences, or pre-med programs. Visual diagrams, real-world analogies, and interactive challenge questions will be included in each class. Practice problems and review questions will be provided after each lesson.

## Syllabus

1.	Cell Theory, Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes, and Microscopy
2.	Organelles and Cell Specialization
3.	Membrane Transport, Homeostasis, and Cell Communication
