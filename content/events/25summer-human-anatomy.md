## Description

This four-week course is designed for middle and high school students with a strong foundation in biology who want to explore the human body in depth. We'll dive into how your body is organized: from cells and tissues to entire systems to how everything works together to keep you alive and functioning. Along the way, you'll learn the real terms doctors and scientists use, study what organs do (and what happens when things go wrong), and connect structure to function across multiple systems. This course is fast-paced and ideal for students considering medicine, health science, or advanced biology. Each class will include visuals, real-life examples, and challenge questions with guided solutions to reinforce learning. Practice problems will be provided after each class.

## Syllabus

1.	Terminology, and Tissue Types
2.	Skeletal, Muscular, and Integumentary Systems
3.	Circulatory, Respiratory, and Digestive Systems
4.	Nervous, Endocrine, and Reproductive Systems
