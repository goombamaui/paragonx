## Description

This four-week course will kickstart students' journey into physics by covering the fundamental principle of kinematic in depth to understand more advanced techniques later in their physics journey. Each class will consist of a lecture, and problems will be discussed to reinforce material. After every class, students will be assigned homework, which is expected to take an hour to complete. Upon finishing this course, students will be ready to take more advanced physics courses offered in the fall. There are no physics prerequisites for this course, but a strong foundation in algebra and trigonometry is helpful.
