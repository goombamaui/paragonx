## Description

This ten-week course is for students (in 10th grade or below) aiming to qualify for the AIME and who already have had experience in math competitions like AMC 8 or MATHCOUNTS. This AMC 10 class will teach the required concepts for AMC 10 and solve difficult questions for students to have the skills to qualify for (and most likely get a good score on) the AIME. Each week, we will meet for 1.5 hours to explain concepts in Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry and Combinatorics as well as solve example problems while learning important strategies; weekly homework will also be assigned and discussed in the following class.
