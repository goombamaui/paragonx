## Description

This 11-week course will help students progress from high school physics to introductory college-level physics by preparing them for the AP Physics 1: Algebra-Based exam. During each class, the instructor will first lecture about fundamental concepts, then pose problems that reinforce the material for students to solve, many of them drawn from past AP Physics 1 administrations. The homework is expected to take up to one hour per class to complete. Solid understanding of algebra 1 and geometry is recommended, and some familiarity with trigonometry would also benefit the student.

The syllabus is based on the eight AP Physics 1 units listed on the College Board Course and Exam Description, with two classes each devoted to Units, 1, 2, and 3, three fundamental and frequently tested ones.
