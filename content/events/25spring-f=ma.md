## Description

The ParagonX F=ma class is a 12-week course designed to prepare students for the 2026 F=ma contest. The course begins with developing stronger foundations in common subjects that may not be dealt with in depth in regular physics courses. Afterwards, the class will delve into specific tricks to solve complicated problems. The last three classes of this course are dedicated to three mock tests with solutions that will help students get a feel for the contest environment. Prerequisites: High School Physics & Algebra 2.
