## Description

This 10-week course targets students who enjoy algebra and want to find a neat way to link algebra with geometry. Those who do this course preferably should be nearing AIME qualification or have already qualified for the AIME. This class is 1.5 hours every week. By completing this course, a student who may be initially struggling in geometry will find confidence in being able to solve a good deal of AIME geometry problems using this method. Every week, there are problems for homework that require critical thinking to further enhance learning.
