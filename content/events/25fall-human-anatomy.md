## Description

This eight-week course is designed for middle and high school students with a solid foundation in biology who want to explore the human body in depth. Students will examine how the body’s systems are structured, how they function individually, and how they interact to maintain health and homeostasis. We’ll cover major systems including the skeletal, muscular, cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, endocrine, digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems. Students will learn about key organs, tissues, and cells within each system, and explore physiological processes such as circulation, respiration, neural signaling, hormone regulation, and metabolism. By the end of the course, students will be able to explain how the body maintains balance, responds to internal and external stimuli, and coordinates complex functions, all while using precise scientific terminology. This fast-paced, interactive course is ideal for students preparing for advanced biology, biomedical sciences, or pre-med programs. Lessons will feature detailed anatomical diagrams, real-world analogies, case studies, and interactive challenge questions, with practice problems and review exercises provided after each session.
