## Description

This class provides preparation for the AMC 10/12 and AIME, the beginning competitions of the pathway for the eventual selection of the U.S. team for the International Mathematics Olympiad. This course covers topics in Algebra, Combinatorics, Number Theory, and Geometry that are crucial for success in these exams. Time will be spent with applying simpler techniques in creative ways to solve hard problems, as well as slowly introducing students to more advanced, introductory Olympiad material.
