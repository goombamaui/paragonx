## Description

This 10-week course surveys entry-level olympiad combinatorics. Not many theorems are introduced; instead, the course focuses on common strategies or ideas that recur throughout combinatorics. This course is targeted for those getting into olympiad math from computational math and also competitive programmers aiming to improve at so-called "ad-hoc" problems.
